# FraudShield: Transaction Anomaly Detection System

## üìå Overview
FraudShield is a **machine learning-based fraud detection system** designed to identify suspicious financial transactions with high accuracy. By leveraging **XGBoost, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and anomaly detection techniques** like **Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**, this system ensures robust fraud prevention in real-time payment environments.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Multi-Model Approach:** Utilizes **XGBoost, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression** to classify fraudulent transactions.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Implements **Isolation Forest and LOF** to detect unusual transaction patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts transaction-based features such as **amount variations, balance fluctuations, and entity behaviors**.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves **98.89% accuracy** in fraud detection.
- **Scalable Pipeline:** Designed for real-time fraud prevention in **financial applications**.

## üìä Dataset
- **Source:** The dataset consists of financial transactions labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
- **Size:** ~6.3 million transactions with **11 features**.
- **Key Columns:**
  - `amount`: Transaction amount.
  - `oldbalanceOrg`, `newbalanceOrig`: Sender‚Äôs balance before and after the transaction.
  - `oldbalanceDest`, `newbalanceDest`: Receiver‚Äôs balance before and after the transaction.
  - `isFraud`: Label indicating fraudulent transactions.

## üîç Machine Learning Models Used
1. **XGBoost**: Optimized for high-performance classification.
2. **Decision Trees**: Provides interpretability in fraud decision-making.
3. **Logistic Regression**: Baseline model for fraud probability estimation.
4. **Isolation Forest & LOF**: Detect anomalies by identifying transactions that deviate from normal behavior.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** 98.89%
- **F1 Score & ROC AUC:** Evaluated to measure precision and recall balance.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Transaction amount, balance fluctuations, and entity-specific behaviors were key indicators.

## üìå How to Run the Project
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Soniaranvir/fraud-shield-detection.git
