# FraudTransactionsDetection

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to develop a **fraud detection system** for financial transactions using machine learning. The model is designed to accurately identify fraudulent activities and prevent potential financial losses. By leveraging various machine learning algorithms and advanced data analytics techniques, this solution enhances security and trust in financial transactions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains transaction data with various features such as transaction type, amount, origin, and destination balances. The data is preprocessed, analyzed, and used to train a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions.

### 🔹 Data Columns:
- `step` - The time step of the transaction.
- `type` - The type of transaction (e.g., PAYMENT, TRANSFER, CASH_OUT).
- `amount` - The amount involved in the transaction.
- `nameOrig` - The customer’s account number initiating the transaction.
- `oldbalanceOrg` - The account balance before the transaction.
- `newbalanceOrig` - The account balance after the transaction.
- `nameDest` - The recipient’s account number.
- `oldbalanceDest` - The recipient's balance before the transaction.
- `newbalanceDest` - The recipient's balance after the transaction.
- `isFraud` - **Target variable** (1 = Fraudulent, 0 = Legitimate).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
- **Data Processing** (Feature Engineering, Normalization, Handling Missing Values)

## 🚀 Implementation
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and duplicates.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize numerical values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze transaction trends and fraud patterns.
   - Visualize fraud distributions.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation:**
   - Train multiple machine learning models.
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Deployment (Optional):**
   - Deploy the fraud detection model using Flask/FastAPI.
   - Integrate with financial systems for real-time fraud detection.

## 📊 Results
- Achieved **high precision and recall** in fraud detection.
- Reduced false positives while maintaining detection accuracy.
- Improved transaction security with real-time fraud analysis.
